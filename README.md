The purpose of this project is to expand the capabilities of a [SCADA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCADA)
testbed based on [Lego Mindstorms EV3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms_EV3) bricks and [Raspberry Pi boards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi) (cf. [LegoSCADA](http://www-public.tem-tsp.eu/~garcia_a/web/prototypes/legoscada/)).

The current prototype mainly focuses on two SCADA protocols, [Modbus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modbus) and [DNP3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNP3). DNP3 allows more hardware compatibility, and possible security improvements which are under implementation in the [OpenDNP3 libraries](https://www.automatak.com/opendnp3/).

The prototype includes as well as a set of adversarial models to fully test novel security techniques. The adversaries vary in knowledge level and computational power, in order to provide an in-sight of the opponent perspective and difficulties, when using the security
features.
